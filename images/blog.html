                        Creating a blog for your university or college is a no-brainer;
                         blogs are an essential part of any school’s content marketing strategy.
                          Coming up with content on a weekly or daily basis for that blog, however, 
                          is another matter. The cyclical nature of higher education is a blessing and a curse; 
                          it can make it easier to plan content around the calendar year and upcoming annual deadlines, 
                          but it can also leave blog editors struggling for fresh ideas, especially if their blog is more established.
                        
                        With that in mind, we’ve come up with 75 blog ideas for your university or college blog. 
                        For added convenience, we’ve organized these content ideas into four categories based on the suggested author of each blog post:
                         current students, alumni, faculty, and admissions professionals. We’ve also included a fifth bonus category, which contains content 
                         from other author groups, such as your enrolled students, career services office, etc.
